## Project Overview

- This website presents the latest information on Covid-19 in the UK North-East, specifically, County Durham, Darlington and Newcastle.

  - Based on the above statistics, the website labels each area either high/medium/low risk.
  - Allows users to filter government advice/guidelines based on tier level.
  - Presents an interactive, colour-coded choropleth map for each region, indicating the severity of the outbreak there.
  - Displays the availability of hospitals as a percentage of how many beds are occupied with Covid-19 patients.
